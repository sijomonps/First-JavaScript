# 🧮 Simple JavaScript Counter
</div>

This is one of the first projects I made when I started learning JavaScript.  
Out of pure curiosity, I created a **simple counter web app** with three buttons:

- ➖ Decrease  
- 🔁 Reset  
- ➕ Increase  

The number at the top updates instantly when each button is pressed.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to understand how JavaScript works in a webpage —  
how buttons interact with the DOM and how values update on the screen.

And the best part?  
### **I did not use AI to build this. I coded everything myself from scratch.**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used
**HTML**  
**CSS**  
**JavaScript**

---

## 🎯 What I Learned
- DOM manipulation  
- Event listeners  
- Updating UI using JavaScript  
- Writing simple, clean logic
